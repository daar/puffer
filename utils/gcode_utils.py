"""
Module for sending G-code commands and parsing responses.

This module provides utility functions to send G-code commands to a connected
3D printer via a serial connection and to parse responses received from the printer.
"""


def send_gcode(serial_connection, gcode, callback=None):
    """
    Send a G-code command to the 3D printer via the serial connection.

    This function writes a G-code command to the printer through the provided
    serial connection. Optionally, a callback function can be used to log or
    display the sent command.

    Args:
        serial_connection (serial.Serial): The serial connection to the printer.
        gcode (str): The G-code command to send. It will be stripped of whitespace.
        callback (function, optional): A function to handle logging or other actions
                                        after sending the command. It receives a string
                                        argument with the sent G-code message.

    Example:
        send_gcode(serial_conn, "M105", print)
        # Output: Sent: M105

    Parse the response from the 3D printer after sending G-code commands.

    This function reads lines from the serial connection until all available
    data is retrieved and decodes each line. The response is returned as a list
    of strings, with each line of the response as a separate item.

    Args:
        serial_connection (serial.Serial): The serial connection to the printer.

    Returns:
        list of str: A list of response lines received from the printer.

    Example:
        response = parse_gcode_response(serial_conn)
        print(response)
